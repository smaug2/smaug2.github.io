<h2><strong>Welcome Gamers!</strong></h2>
<p></p>
 <p><strong>CORONAVIRUS UPDATE: </strong> We have decided to cancel the in-person MAGE Con event (initially planned to be held at the local high school), but we WILL be having an online version. See below.</p>
 <hr/>
 
<p>The MAGES (Mahomet Area Gaming EnthusiastS) invite you to join us for our third annual MAGE Con!  Due to coronavirus concerns, we are holding the event entirely online this year.

Even though we have cancelled the in-person event, we sincerely appreciate the support and sponsorship by the Mahomet-Seymour High School's Dungeons and Dragons club.

The dates for MAGE Con will be Saturday and Sunday, July 11th and 12th, 2020. We hope you will join us and help make the 2020 event a critical success.</p>
<p><strong>There will be NO registration fee for MAGE Con this year. It will be FREE!  But, to participate, you'll need to register and sign up for games.  </strong>
 
 <p>For general questions, feel free to email:&nbsp; <a href="mailto:archmage@magecon.org">archmage@magecon.org</a></p>

<p><strong><font color="blue">As in the past, Dungeons and Dragons 5e Adventurers League play will be a large part of MAGE Con, but we had such a good time last year with our friends from the local Pathfinder & Starfinder Society Organized Play group, we'd love to have them back again in 2020. Interest has also been expressed in running Shadowrun and some other games, so we are hoping the 2020 event will be a critical success!  </font></strong></p>
