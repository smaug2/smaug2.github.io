<p><strong><font color="blue">As in the past, Dungeons and Dragons 5e Adventurers League play will be a large part of MAGE Con, but we had such a good time with our friends from the local Pathfinder & Starfinder Society Organized Play group, we'd love to have them back again in 2020. Interest has also been expressed in running Shadowrun and some other games, so we are hoping the 2020 event will be a critical success!  </font></strong></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:&nbsp;</strong> Stay tuned here for future updates.  </p>
