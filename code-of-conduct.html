<h1><strong>Anti-Harassment Policy</strong></h1>
<hr /><hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MAGE Con seeks to provide a welcoming, fun, and safe convention and community. We do not tolerate harassment in any form. Discriminatory language and imagery (including sexual) is not appropriate for any venue, including the convention sessions and any community resources such as the MAGE Con Facebook page. MAGE Con staff (red badges; red "Staff" group online) have both the power and the duty to investigate all reported incidents of harassment and to remove confirmed harassers from MAGE Con venues both physical and virtual.</p>
<p>Harassment is understood as any behavior that threatens another person or group or produces an unsafe or un-inclusive environment. It includes offensive verbal comments or non-verbal expressions related to gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religious beliefs, sexual or discriminatory images in public spaces (including online), deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
<h1><strong>Conflict Resolution</strong></h1>
<hr /><hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Initial Incident</strong><br /> If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please first consider informing the offender that the speech or behavior is problematic and that you would like them to stop. Oftentimes, the offending behavior is unintentional, and the accidental offender and offended will resolve the incident by ceasing the behavior and/or apologizing. If you believe that bringing up the incident with the offender will have negative consequences for you or will only lead to further offenses, then please inform a staff member (red badges; red "Staff" group online) about the incident.</li>
<li><strong> Escalation</strong><br /> If the offender insists that he/she did not offend, or if the offender continues the harassment after being asked to stop, then you will need a third party to step in. Find a staff member and let them know about the incident. If the issue is in MAGE Con websites (like the Facebook page), please email staff at dan.webb@mchsi.com.</li>
<li><strong> Investigation</strong><br /> MAGE Con staff are obligated to investigate thoroughly any reported incidents of harassment, seeking private accounts of the incident from all concerned parties.</li>
</ol>
<h1><strong>Sanctions</strong></h1>
<hr /><hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MAGE Con participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, staff may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, expelling the offender from MAGE Con, or banning the offender from the MAGE Con user community.</p>
<p>Specific sanctions may include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>warning the harasser to cease their behavior and that any further reports will result in other sanctions</li>
<li>requiring that the harasser avoid any interaction with, and physical proximity to, their victim for the remainder of the event</li>
<li>requiring that the harasser immediately leave MAGE Con and not return</li>
<li>not allowing a person who violated the policy to attend future MAGE Cons</li>
<li>ending immediately any event responsibilities and privileges the harasser holds and requiring that the harasser not attend future MAGE Cons (either indefinitely or for a certain time period)</li>
<li>publishing an account of the harassment</li>
</ul>
<p>MAGE Con staff (red badges; red "Staff" group online) will help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event.</p>
<p>We expect participants to follow these rules in all MAGE Con venues, MAGE Con-related social events, and online communication channels.</p>
<p>We value your participation in the MAGE Con community and your efforts to keep MAGE Con a safe and friendly space for all participants!</p>
